**Nursing Checklist Manager

Standardization of nursing skills validation and procedural processes across the healthcare continuum helps to lower the risk for medical errors and hospital acquired infections.

In order to assist in the implementation of a more standardized process, the Checklist Manager App will help to provide a more mobile alternative to a historically paper-driven process by allowing users to create and manager their own checklists as well as the checklists of other nurses.
